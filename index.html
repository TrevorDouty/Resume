        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Working for many different companies with a variety of positions have given me the skills I will need to be a
          succesful software developer. Pursuing a bachelors degree in biology led to the knowledge of how to research
          and problem solve. Course like chemistry, calculus, and physics all compounded this knowledge. Receiving a
          degree gave me the confidence achieve even the hardest of pursuits. As a car salesman I learned customer
          service skills that could compliment my understanding of hard work. My time at Boise CodeWorks prepared me to
          meet industry standards while understanding that the world of software is always evolving. They equipped me
          with the skills to keep up with best practice and learn new information quickly and effectively.</p>
